# dotfiles

I have not made an install script yet but will keep track of as many necessary steps as I can here in the README.




I am basing my workflow of off the dotfiles found here:

https://github.com/FelixKratz/dotfiles/tree/master



Currently the following must be manually symlinked


``` bash
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.config/sketchybar ~/.config/sketchybar
```
